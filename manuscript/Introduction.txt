# Introduction

This record has been compiled primarily for my family, Richard and Sandra and for Jeanine's sons, Geoff and Mark and of course, their progeny.

Our ancestors created a very special place on Taveuni and I had the privilege of being part of the last phase of a very unique way of life.  It has now gone and will never be experienced again.  

Accordingly I consider I have an obligation to record, as fully as memory and records will allow, every detail of the family's involvement with Taveuni.

I should make it clear that this account is incomplete.  It is written from the perspective of the H. V. Tarte branch of the family.  The A. R. Tartes may have another story to tell.

Anyone going to Taveuni today, or in the years to come, will find it almost impossible to belive that the places and people I have describe herein were real.

It is a tragedy that the enormous development, which was carried out on the island for over 100 years was so comprehensively eroded in such a short space of time.

It all seems like a wonderful dream.

But it was real and I pray that when Richard and Sandra and Geoff and Mark read these pages they will have a sense of affinity with the place, which for me, will always be home.
