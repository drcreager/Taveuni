# THE ORIGINS

The Hugenots are descendants of the French Protestants, who through religious persecution, were driven from France and the Low Countries to take refuge in England between the years 1560 to 1782.

The main exodus of Huguenots from France was caused by the massacre on St. Bartholomew’s Eve in 1572, and later during a period before and after the revolution of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, which gave freedom from religious persecution. Forbidden to leave France, Huguenots sought every means of escape and some crossed the Channel concealed in beer barrels.

The Huguenots brought the cream of artificers to England - silk weavers, tapestries, colour printers, ivory turners, goldsmiths, hat makers, etc.

Most of them settled in the East End of London, Canterbury, Rochester and Dover.

Through the records of the Huguenot Society, it has been possible to trace possible ancestors (TART - TARTE - de TART etc.) with details of marriages and baptisms in the year 1689 in the Registers of the French Church of Threadneedle Street, and the Church of La Patente de Soho.

Among the families of Huguenot extraction were the Chamberlains, the first to practice medicine in this country during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.  Pierre Chamberlain, who practised as a surgeon in Mark Lane in 1625, was famous as the inventor of the obstetric forceps, the secret of which was kept in his family for 100 years. Pierre Chamberlain was physician to Queen Henrietta Maria and the Chamberlain family attended the successive Queens of England in the 17th century.

For a further 100 years the secret of the obstetric forceps lay hidden in an attic of Woodham Mortimer Hall, a short distanace from West Maldon - the home of Dr. Peter Chamberlain.

Pierre Chamberlain, appears as a witness of a baptism of one of the Tarte ancestors in 1609 in the records of the French Church in Threadneedle Street. 

The name “Tart” or “Tarte” appears in many records, notably, in Stows Survey of London, when John Tart, a brewer, became Lord Mayor of London in 1614, when he gave his brewhouse to be taken over for the enlargement of the St. Anthonie Church.

In 1710 a record appears in the Church of La Patente de Soho of Pierre, Grenadier de la Reyne, married to Mlle. Marianne du Tarte.

Many Huguenot families died in the Plague and the Great Fire of London and it was customary for sponsors to stand in for parents at baptisms etc.

Some of the famous Huguenot names, of which there are ancestors in the present Huguenot Society of London, were - Dumas, Courtauld, de Crespigny, Bosanquet, De La Rue, Lefevre, de la Mare.

There are numerous families of TART or TARTE in various parts of England notably of Dungeness, where practically the whole population there are fishermen and run the lifeboat, carrying out the same trade as their ancestors of 400 years ago, who came from Brittany. Some settled at Dover and others carried on up the River Severn, as far, as they could go, to Shrewsbury, where the Tarte family, and about three other TART families originated. Most of the family Christian names appear to have been handed down from Huguenot times, quite a few of Biblical origin - John, Jacob, Sharrat, Rebecca, George, Henry, William, Jonas etc.
