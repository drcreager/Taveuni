# Herbert Valentine Tarte - The Heir

## Section I

H.V. Tarte kept no diary and there are few details of his life.  The following account is from records that are available. 

Old J.V. Tarte handed over control of the plantation to Herbert and Rood in October 1911 and they managed it under the name Tarte Brothers.  They continued to buy freehold land and by 1914 owned about 7,000 acres of the best land on Taveuni.  They also applied to takeover a very substantial lease of 2,000 acres on the eastern coast of Taveuni known as Ravilevu.  They offered 6d. per acre for the first 10 years and 2/6d per acre thereafter.  Although it was the going rate at the time their offer was not accepted.

The two sons continued to run the plantation in much the same way as J.V. had done.  But they suffered severe setbacks from the hurricanes of 1912 and 1929 which did tremendous damage not only to the coconut trees but the coastal areas where a number of building were located and also the tramline along the coast.  One thing they did was to employ more European overseers and tradesmen. 

H.V. attended school in Australia and stayed on to gain experience in book-keeping and business management with an insurance firm and a stock and station agency.  After his return and before the partnership was set up, J.V. placed most of his trust in Herbert rather than Rood.  Even so Herbert was given very little responsibility while his father was still alive and in control.

After the partnership had been set up Herbert became more involved in local and national affairs.  He became Post Master at Vuna and Captain of the Taveuni Rifle Club.  With his involvement in national politics he was away for extended periods in Suva.  He was elected to the Legislative Council in 1920 and moved several motions the criticized government and tried to promote the general welfare of coconut planters. 

He resigned from the Legislative Council in 1922 through ill health. 

Rood ____joined up and____ went overseas to take part in the First World War and it was while he was away the H.V.'s health began to wane.  He wrote to the Colonial Secretary requresting that Rood be released from military duties so he could return to look after the affairs of the plantation.  Herbert felt he would have to go overseas for an extended period to recuperate his health.

Herbert married Sarah Lilian Thomas in Melbourne.  They had 4 children, James Valentine, Herbert Valentine, Theona and Diana.  She tells her won story of her early years on Taveuni.

"In the excitement of preparing for the wedding, the household gradually became as gay as myself.  Only very intimate friends were invited, but to my surprise, when I arrived at the church, the crowd not only filled the interior, but the garden and footpath as well.  Tactful people said it was on my account.  Others inferred they had come to see the man from the cannibal islands. 

When we reached Sydney next day we went direct to the hospital where my husband's younger sister was lying dangerously ill.  We was deeply attached to her and only then did I understand the strange depression that clung to him at our wedding.  He had told me then she was not well enough to travel to Melbourne and spared me the pain of the telegram he's received to the effect that the doctors could hold out little hope of her living longer than a few weeks.  She was a beautiful girl of sixteen and it was a terrible shock to us both.  A cable had gone to her parents summoning them to come by the first steamer.  

Shortly after our arrival, we were told a serious haemorrhage had set in and it meant but a few hours to the end.  My husband was stricken with grief and feared the shock would just about kill the old people.  In his despair he prayed desperately that her life would at least be spared another ten days until the arrival of the boat from Fiji.  It was all very harrowing and distressing, especically as one felt so helpless.  I could hardly believe my ears when in less than an hour the doctor, an eminent Sydney surgeon, telephoned to say the haemorrhage had stopped.  He described it as a miracle, adding that it also was unaccountable, could only be temporary and liable to start again at any moment.  My sister-in-law lived for a week after people came. 

They were days of frightful tension, awaiting the arrival of the Island vessel.  It was difficult to realise I was a bride and on my honeymoon.  My husband could make no secret of his unhappiness and I, being extremely sensitive, perforce shared it. 

We had to return by the boat on which the old people travelled.  It was a sad parting, but the plantation could not be left without a manager.  I remember the absurd thought flashed through my mind that there was no need to fear we should be taken for newlyweds, as we certainly lacked the light step and verve of the honeymooner.  If anything, we were a sombre couple.

Accompanying us was a housekeeper my mother had selected to guide me through the shoals of housekeeping.  She had a figure like an animated beer barrel, and a mouth that shut with a snap like a clam, but I felt she would more that camouflage my ignorance, so tried to overlook face and figure.  I would certainly have objected if I had seen her in Melbourne, but by this time, it was a case of any port in a storm, and she had lived in the tropics. 

When a few days cut from Sydney, my husband woke me one night to say his sister was dead.  I told him not to be foolish, that he had been dreaming, or else the sleepless, worrying nights he'd been though had given him hallucinations; but he insisted he saw her die, and all my persuasion would not convince him to the contrary.  He acted from then on until our arrival in Suva, as if his presentiment were true.  Our agent there met us with a cable to say my sister-in-law died at the hour my husband had told me.

It was only natural that I should look upon all this unhappiness with superstition.  I was in the state of wondering what on earth would happen next.

* * * 

We had two days' interval in Suva before the arrival of the little interinsular steamer that was to take us home.  The beauty of the place enthralled me - the vivid sunsets with towering palms silhouetted darkly against the brilliance; the bronze-like Fijians, and the happy smiles I received from them all.  I was a bit disturbed though, when I placed one of my new trousseau hats on my head to find the flower had started to melt, and more disturbed still when, running a hat-pin through, I felt something rush madly over my scalp.  I flung the hat on the floor with a shriek.  Nothing moved, so I picked it up very carefully and examined it, to find a mouse had crept into the lining and objected to a pin being stuck in it.  

Another hat was selected and we drove in a landau to a small native village where the reeded and thatched huts were set out on a large compound, smooth and green as a lawn.  Curls of blue smoke from the outdoor ovens rose into the air and the dense forest in the background resembled a tapestry of shimmering greens.  Bright-coloured plants nestled against the straw shaded houses and goo-eyed naked children peered out of doorways.  Old grannies sat inside smiling welcomes and, with the sight of their lined brown faces, white hair, rows of strong teeth, I gave a little shudder wondering if they still liked the taste of human flesh.  

It was just about dusk when we returned and, while sitting on the verandah of the hotel, the Turaga (which name I shall now call my husband, being Fijian for gentleman and bestowed on him by his native labour) suddenly remembered that he had left his raincoat (a most necessary possession in Fiji) at the Club, so I offered to walk along with him.  The Club was at the top of a hill and as I was feeling the heat he said, "You walk slowly and I shall hurry on, get my coat and return at once."

When he had gone some way ahead, I thought I heard a strange noise behind me and, turning round, noticed a massive Fijian a little way off making in my direction, waving what apperared to be a head-hunting club.  No one else was in sight so I increased my speed.  So did he.  Then he started to yell dreadful gibberish at me, wielding the club as if he intended to throw it at me if I didn't stop - to be eaten, I imagined.  

By this time, I had gathered a speed hitherto unimaginable to me and was at the screaming stage when I saw the Turaga tearing down the hill to my rescue.  He couldn't speak for laughing.  Trembling, I clung to him and heard with relief that the "savage" had walked five miles from the native village to return my unbrella which I'd left there.  He had been waving it wildly in the air as a signal for me to wait. 

The shock sent me to bed very early that evening.  I stripped the blanket from the bed and lifted the pillow that needed shaking, when I discovered a pipe (not my husband's) underneath.  I tried to procure fresh bed linen, but the housekkeeper had departed with the keys of the cupboard, so I spread my rug over the mattress and proceeded to lock the doors of the room to bar the entrance of cannibals!

The Turaga emphasised the quietness of the people among whom I was to live and said he was very tired and could not possibly sleep with the doors shut, that the heat was far too oppressive, so I contented myself with lying down and resting until he was asleep, when I slipped out of bed and locked the door leading into the passage.  The lock of the balcony French windows had rusted, so I placed a chair and a bedroom jug of water against them.  I fell asleep almost immediately.  About 12 p.m. I was aroused suddenly by an awful crash as the door gave way.  Someone was calling between hiccups, "Mick! Are you there?"  Then followed yells from the room below, fearful guttural sounds, a rushing of feet along the passage and someone trying to bash in our door.

With one leap I was in the Turaga's bed.  He roared at the unseen intruder, "What the hell's the matter?" and flew to open the door.  There stood the irate German proprietor.  He ignored us and rushed to the overturned water jug which was quite empty, all the contents having gone through the cracks in the floor on to the newly procured billiard table below.  The stray drunk that had pushed it over trying to open the door had sobered up and vanished.  The poor German was beside himself with grief, all his savings for six months having gone to buy the precious table.

The dawn was a welcome sight and all that day was spent buying provisions - mostly tinned - to take home, and in receiving callers.  I felt completely dithered by all the advice and suggestions I received and ready for a good night's rest on the little steamer that was to carry us to our island home a hundred miles across the sunny Pacific.  I was in the first flush of youth, daunted by nothing and full of romance. 

* * *

We were sailing at 4 a.m. so decided to sleep on board.  The Fijian steward made up our bunks on deck and put the "Ugly Duchess", as we called the housekeeper, down below.  

I lay and gazed unwinkingly at the brilliance of the moonlit sky, thinking what a sacrilege to sleep on such a night.  It was a miracle of beauty, stirring one to the depths with a sad consciousness of all that is unattainable.  There was a magic line to the faint sweep of clouds and a turbulence in the boom of the surf over the coral reef half a mile away.  The boat rocked as gently as a lullaby and I was on the verge of losing consciousness when I heard English voices approaching.  As they rang clearer, I saw two men with rolling gait approaching the steamer. They tried to board her without the aid of the gangway and missed their footing.  There was a loud splash followed by another, then silence.  "Dear", I cried shaking my husband, "two men are overboard." Poor Turaga! He was gradually resigning himself to my various nightmare awakenings.  Rubbing his eyes, he gazed at me stupidly, crying "For goodness sake, go to sleep.  You've had a bad dream." I told him I hadn't closed my eyes, only to hear "Oh, everyone says that when waking from nightmare." 

I had made such a noise in the quietness that had prevailed that the Fijian night watchman appeared and put his lamp over the side at my direction.  Seeing a man floundering in the water, he was overboard without a moment's hesitation.  There was a struggle as the man tried to fight him.  The Turga found a rope which he threw to them, also a life buoy, then the captain appeared, and after difficulty a man was hauled up.  There seemed to be yards of him and just as his limp form was about to be landed safely, he fell back.  The Captain jumped in and some of the crew arrived and eventually succeeded in bringing two very weak, almost lifeless bodies on deck.  I'm sure that sober men would never have recovered a quickly as these two did. 

It was daylight when I woke to feel the boat rolling heavily and the rain beating down on us.  We were forced to go below and then the fun began.  The old tub went through all the tricks she knew.  We felt we were dying, but were to ill to voice the fact.  She seemed to go forward a few yards, then slide back, then reel from collision with terrifying waves, or else dive like a duck, apparently looking for something at the bottom of the ocean.  She groaned and strained and creaked while an awful steering chain rumbled and scraped incessantly on the deck overhead.  She would have made a good machine for washing clothes for she churned andd twisted and rubbed and seemed to wring our bodies of their very contents.  

At midday, a Fijian appeared in dungaree trousers and black singlet, rather like a messenger of doom, to know if we would take any food!  Speech had left us long ago.  All we were capable of was giving - not receiving.  

As night came on, I found a porthole leaking and my bedding becoming saturated, but I hadn't strength to complain when the steward, still in black singlet, lit the swinging, smelly oil lamp. 

Cockroaches raced up the down the walls, and during the night, the Turaga felt a touch on his cheek and, opening his eyes, saw a rat perched on his pillow working his whiskers as though trying to decide which part to start eating first. 

We endured another tempestuous night and when morning broke, were at our destination. 

I was awakened by a cry of "All ashore".  The boat lying at anchor, we crawled out of our bunks and I went to arouse the Duchess. 

"The boat is waiting for us to go ashore", I weakly explained.  

"Waiting indeed!" she exploded.  "It can go on waiting.  I have been all over the world and never been through such an experience.  Sunny Pacific indeed!  You should have told me I was coming to this.  I feel like demanding compensation.  I'm a mass of bruises."

Leaving the tornado in full blast, I fled. 

Eventually, we climbed off into the rowing boat that was to take us ashore and, sick though I felt, I couldn't help being aware of the surrounding beauty - the vast strech of opalescent water, the long white curving line of coral beach, and the general green contour of the island with its pinnacle-shaped hills in the distance, sloping into groves and groves of coconut palms. 

There was no warf or landing place.  Natives waded out waist-deep and carried us pick-aback ashore, wading in again for our luggage and goods.  

We had "dropped anchor" at last.  This dream of visual loveliness was home.  Taveuni!  How apt and mellow to the tongue I thought was this Fijian name for garden.  (One of my friends once addressed her letter Tapioca!) 

* * * 

We were met on the beach by one John Saunders, an athletic and handsome young cadet, a friend of the family, and apprenticed to learn coconut planting.  He conducted us to the homestead belonging to the old people which we were to occupy during the months they would be in Australia and until we had designed and built our own.

It was a solid stone building with walls three feet thick made to withstand the hurricanes that periodically worked destruction throughtout this particular group of islands.  It was attractively situated on the slight rise, the garden sloping smoothly down to the sea.  The miles beyond rose the blue hills of a large island - a magical belt of colour on the horizon and giving the illusion of a lake to the vast stretch of water.  The lawn was panoplied with bright patches of scarlet salvia, hibiscus and crotons.  Low walls of black volcanic rock marked the termination of the garden and were in sharp contrast to the purple bouganvillea trailing across it.

All of this I marvelled at while on the verandah having tea and toast and cool pawpaw, then settled to the business of unpacking and opening up our wedding gifts. 

The Duchess still seemed a bit grouchy, complained of feeling hot, sniffing at the concrete floor in the kitchen and passing withering remarks about the flies and mosquitoes.  She asked me why I had come here and why my mother hadn't taken me to India, adding "You might have made a proper match there and married into the Army!"  I told her almost meekly that I was quite happy, to which she retorted "Of course you have to say that.  However. 'Blessed are the peacemakers'".  

Despite her aggressive attitude, she prepared a marvellous dinner out of various tinned products and so disguised the bully beef that was difficult to know what exactly we were eating.  

In the evening the Turga and I strolled along the beach in the moonlight, surely more wondrous in the tropics that anywhere.  We sat for a while listening to the lapping of the waves, grateful for our happiness and planning all sorts of adventures for the future. 

It was quite late when we returned and approached the garden, so still and mystic in the clear light.  It seemed part of a dream, free from blemish and much too beautiful to be real.  Unconsciously our voices grew hushed as we walked through it.

Later, when undressing, still part of the dream, I heard a great scuttle over the floor near me, and sprang on to a chair justs in time to miss an enormous crab making for my bare feet.  I might have known something grotesque would happen, that there was a catch to all this paradisal beauty.  I called frantically to the Turga, but the horrible creature had disappeared on to the lawn.  

Sleep fortunately, came quickly after the dreadfully uncomfortable time on the steamer.  I awoke at dawn to see, just two inches from my nose, the silhouette of a crab.  I thought I was dreaming, but leapt with a yell when I saw it give a sly move.  'Twas my visitor of the night.  The mosquito net had fallen to the floor and it had crawled up on the inside and was to near my nose that, without doubt, its touch had wakened me!

* * * 

Weeks of great happiness followed.  Whenever possible, I accompanied the Turaga around the plantation as he worked.  We had great fishing excursions, mostly trolling, one afternoon bringing home 300 lbs.  Weight of fish, ranging individually from about 6 lbs to 50 lbs.  These excursions could only take place at the weekends, for there was always too much to see to on the plantation during the week.  John Saunders, quite an expert with the rod and line, alway came with us.  

We had one very exciting and amusing afternoon.  The Turaga usually caught the greatest number of, and John, the largest fish.  On this particular occasion they had had an equal catch.  The Turga didn't like this at all, so he kept his line out until the last moment and was just going to wind it up when he helled, "Stop the engine.  By Jove! I've a beauty."  He would up furiously, the fish running towards the boat.  It gave very little play as it came nearer.  He shouted to bring the revolver.  In the dim light it looked a huge thing with two tails and an enormous mouth.

John fired a couple of shots and the monstrous creature was hauled in  It was a pair of dungaree pants!  The hook had caught in the buckle at the back and ad they were pulled along, each leg, of course, bulged with water and the waist looked like a huge gaping mouth, while the legs were the "two tails".

**[TODO:  First Edit - Bookmark]**

We roared with mirth and searching the pockets, found a tiny fish.  "My catch", said the Turga, laughing at John.  "I've beaten you after all."

Only a few nights before we'd caught and landed a horrible looking hammer-headed shark.  The engineer jumped overboard in a panic and it kept the rest off us step-dancing until a Fijian bashed its head with a length of iron ballast. 

* * * 

I loved most the days spent in riding about the plantation.  Labour was cheap and the estate beautifully kept.  It was divided into paddocks by walls of black volcanic rock.  All the gates were kept in excellent order and painted white. 

After the men had collected the ripe coconuts which had fallen, and cut the kernels out to make copra, the husks and fallen leaves were burnt.  Thus the ground was kept free of rubbish and the grass grew luxuriantly for the Herefords, which we bred.  The fattening paddocks were like fields of waving wheat.  Often when we opened a gate to drive a herd to fresh pasture, the guinea grass was so tall and the cattle nervous, the natives had to go ahead and cut a track.  I have seen it seven feet high and when the cattle entered, we, sitting on our horses, could just about see their backs and heads. 

There was scarcely a noxious weed.  If any appeared, the labour were immediately sent to pull them out.  There were here and there lovely patches of shady trees for the cattle to rest under on hot days.  In these vakarurus (shelters) we often found pigeons to bring home for dinner, as invariably we took a gun with us when going any long distance.  

Butterflies were numerous and exceptionally lovely.  Bird life, too, was most interesting.  Showers of brilliant scarlet parakeets, green-blue parrots and wild fowl resembling the game birds of the East, were plentiful in the jungle.  

Memorable days were those when cattle drafting took place. 

We were up before dawn, having breakfast by candle light.  The Turaga used to put a "drop of mountain dew", as he called it, into my tea to set me up for the morning's ride.  It's a splendid refresher and well worth remembering.  

By daybreak we were on the hills.  The air was so keen in the early morning that even in summer one felt the need of a light woolen cardigan.  The labour always went ahead of us and waited our arrival, each man armed with a long stick or plantation knife.  They formed a line at the rear of the paddock from which we intended to drive the cattle, then with a "Ho! Ho! Ho!" from everyone and a clink of knives, the cattle would be startled from their peaceful pasture and rushed ahead. 

In parts the undergrowth was very thick.  Form one area in particular, it was very difficult to drive the cattle and on one occasion they had broken back twice.  This was too much for John Saunders - never a patient soul.  He galloped back in a tearing rage through the bushes and ferns, forgetting the danger of an old disused shaft about 40 feet deep.  The worst happened and he and the horse went full tilt into it.  Fortunately, the shaft was of such proportion as to prevent the horse disappearing immediately. It simply held him comfortably, though of course, he bumped his way deeper and deeper every second. John had seized a a branch of guava bush growing near the edge of the hole and with its help managed to drag himself to safety.

We were half way home with the cattle when he came up panting and told the sad tale.  We sent boys to the homestead for pulleys and ropes.  These were attached to a short tree close to the entrance of the well and a Fijian slipped down on the end of a rope with a wide belly band.  Landing on top of the horse, he put it round the animal, fixing it to a strong rope.  We pulled him up and a few minutes after, the horse, which, with the exception of a few bruises, was unhurt. 

Days full of interest passed, with nothing to mar their happiness except the grumbling of the Duchess, and my fear that, objectionable as she was, she
