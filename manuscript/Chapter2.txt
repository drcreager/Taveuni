**It is not known when J.V. Compiled the following record for it is incomplete.**

“I was born in Birmingham, England, on the 14th February,1837. My father said it was in '36, but as my dear Mother was there at the time and my father was probably absent, I certainly should, to use a horsey expression, be inclined to back the old lady - more especially as I was one of fourteen and she would be pretty right in her dates. As to myself I don't recollect anything about It.

The first thing I recollect (when I must have been about three years old) was riding a large Newfoundland dog up the front steps and along the hall just as the servant had finished washing them. Shortly after, I was got up in a brand new suit to go with a christening party to Church with my sister, and don't I recollect the day - a glorious one!

The Church was not far from the house and all was spic and span for the christening party. I had a pair of white cotton gloves on, but unfortunately for the party, blackberries were in season and the hedges were simply loaded.

They never missed me until they got round the font, when I turned up. My gloves were fairly oozing out with the juice of the blackberry and my dress and face fairly well smudged with it. I would persist in being near my sister who had a light silk dress on (happy childhood).

Some years after, I was sent to school. Those days being so soon after Waterloo, the French were not thought much of. “French frogs", we called them.

At any rate we had a Frenchman to teach us our French lessons.  Unfortunately for him he threatened to cane me for doing something.  I had a great horror as an Englishman of being caned.  It was bad enough being caned by one of my own countrymen, but by a Frenchman!  I dared him to do it and at me he came. 

He was a little chap and had a tremendous crop of hair.  I, at that time, was little, too.  The room we were in was detached from the others.  He was thoroughly detested by the class and when they saw me stand up to him, a ring was soon formed.  At it we went and in the middle of it, in came Mr. Wilkinson - the Headmaster.  He simply separated us and Mr. Frenchy left - he not fit to be seen, and I not much better. 

We played cricket even in those days and the whole school went to the four acres, a favorite cricket ground. When Mr. Wilkinson himself was batting I caught him out, but he said the ball touched the ground first. I said it did not, and was very warm over it. There was no Umpire and all this took up time. He said I was impertinent and would chastise me when we returned to school.

I made up my mind then and there to run away. I was a weekly boarder at the time, so when the muster time came I was absent.  Mr. Wilkinson thought I had gone home, and at home they thought I was at school.  However, they found out their error, and put the police on to find me but by that time I was miles away.

A friend of the family was on a visit to us from Wales on the borders of Shropshire, so I determined to go there. I had fortunately 2 1/2d. in my pocket - the balance of my weekly allowance, so off I trudged.

Towards evening I found a little party of visitors having tea on the veranda so I coolly walked in and asked them if I might have tea with them. As I was nicely dressed in an Eton coat and turned-down white collar, they, of course, were a little flustered, but seeing by my dress I was not an ordinary tramp, they invited me in and any amount of questions as to what I was and where I was going, to which I would give not information, fearing they would send word to Mr. W. or home.

They gave me a bed and I was off at daybreak before they were about.  I walked 25 miles that day on a penny bun and slept under a haystack.  I kept pegging away until I reached my haven.  Of course, as may be imagined, I was pretty done up and my clothes - well - the less said the better.  But I was there.

The daughter, with whom I was very chummy, wheedled out of me what had happened. She hold her father. Fortunately, I heard that my brother was coming down to fetch me home.


My uncle's estate was very near there and a number of gypsies were on it.  As I had often been there with them, I bolted to them, with not a word to my hosts. I can safely say that never in my life did I spend a more jolly time. They were located on my uncle’s estate and they could do many things such as poaching with me as a hostage.

We used to catch hares, rabbits and pheasants. The way they used to track was a caution. It was here I learnt my bush craft - during the six weeks I was living with them. Then I was dragged off home, but that was the last of my schooling as I never went to school again. I was 13.

Engineering was then in the same state of knowledge as electricity and motor cars so my father paid a premium to have me apprenticed to the engineering trade in Birmingham.

Well I may say I was pretty quick at it and came under the notice of my employer. He and I after the others had left, night after night used to be at the pin machine.  The pins used to be cut off in lengths then were sharpened and the head put on afterwards by women - a most tedious process, hence the solid-headed pin that used to be advertised. Well, our machine was to do the whole lot in one act.

We worked at this for nearly two years, as we could only do it after the others were gone, but we did it, and my employer got so excited he took to drinking.  He then moved up to London.  He was a remarkably clever man but there he got worse.  Business fell away so much that I summoned him for not teaching me my trade.  I appeared for myself in Court and I got the indentures cancelled.

I then went to another engineering firm.  It was a very large establishment and they made me second apprentice as I soon showed them I was pretty good in all branches.

The English and French War with Russia were on at this period and I had a very harassing time of it, as of course England and France were not ready for war.  We started at 6.00 in the morning until 5.30 at night With one hour for dinner.

On one occasion I was on a particular piece of work for which the War Office was waiting. I started at 6.00 on Thursday morning and stood at the lathe until 11 on Saturday morning and then collapsed.

Of course I was supplied with plenty to eat and drink and cold water on my head to keep me awake and watchful. I was sent home in a cab and I slept until Monday, about 3.00p.m. The firm sent in a Doctor to see me, but I was all right for Tuesday. It was a terrible time we had of it and I was very glad when Sebastopol was taken and the War ended.

* * *

I shortly after received a letter from my brother, who was in Australia, asking me to come out at once, and enclosing a draft to pay my passage.  How to get away I did not know as my apprenticeship was not out and by that time I was very valuable to the firm.  However, I went and saw the principal, and told him a deliberate lie, which I have always regretted, to the effect that my Mother was dying and that I must go home.

It was three hours' run from London to Birmingham and when I walked in they were astonished.  However, go I would.  I took my passage by the Black Ball liner, "South Carolina".  We sailed out of the Mersey and anchored outside.  A few of us stole the ship's boat and went ashore.  What a jolly time we had for the last time in old England.

I got on board again at 1.00a.m. without their missing the boat but what a fright I had when two detectives came on board, searched the vessel and took two of the passengers ashore.  I thought sure enough it would be my turn next when news of my flight got to London but I got away all right.

I travelled second cabin in a strictly teetotal ship with an apology of a man for a captain - about 5ft tall and as thin as he was short. Like the majority of little
men, he was conceited.

The First Officer, however, was a grand fellow, brave as a lion, 6ft. tall, and built in proportion, with a voice you could hear all over the ship. It was a sailing ship we were in, and when the Captain was on watch he would, in a squeaky voice, order in the studding sails with 2 or 3 reefs in the Royal and Mainsails. Then when the First Officer came on deck, he would, in a voice of thunder, shake out those reefs and run up the stunsails, and my word! Would she not jump to it. One would know when Robertson was on deck by the way she was moving.

There was a large crowd but we soon got shook into our places. One annoyed me very much by putting on side. He was a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy and there were four in our berth. We soon came to fisticuffs. The first time, the Captain said very little but the second time when we adjourned to the forecastle to escape the crowd on deck, he took action.

We were having a ding-dong set-to, in which neither of us seemed to be getting the better, when the Captain appeared.  He ordered both of us to be put in irons aft of the wheelhouse.  Then the fun amongst the passengers commenced.  They held a meeting and decided to have me released at once.  This was done.

There was a young girl on board - a perfect little picture - and we got to be a great chums.  One evening we were sweethearting - to the 2nd officer's great disgust as he thought a lot of her.  In the gloaming he emptied a jug of water over me.  A passenger saw him and told me.  I went for him with a belaying pin and in a great rage landed him one on the head and laid him out on deck.

The Captain, who by no means had forgotten me, had me in irons again.  Then another row commenced. My word it was a row.  All passengers, when they heard the right of it, sided with me and part of the officers and crew sided with the other. It eventually ended by my getting peace restored as we were just going into the Cape of Good Hope.

Word went around that no passengers were allowed to go ashore. However, a large number of bum boats (native boats) came alongside and over went about 300 passengers - 1st, 2nd and 3rd all mixed up together.

Wine was 6d and 1/- per bottle. The latter I thought very good. After being on a teetotal ship, we pegged into it and got very merry. One of the waiters took my attention very much by the great length of his hair and the colour.  I had it in my hand admiring it when he turned round and gave me one in the face, which I promptly returned.

Then the fun got fast and furious.  A few police came but they were no good amongst such a crowd.  In fact they were coloured men and too terrified to do anything.

While this was going on ashore, there was a serious business on board.  The cook got drunk and shot the First Officer through the shoulder.  With his left hand the First Officer brained the cook and was then taken to the hospital.

With others I started to climb Table Mountain but such a terrific downpour of rain came on, we had to return.

I went the next morning to get some everlasting flowers and a great bouquet of other flowers for my girl on board. 

Then I was pulled up by a most rascally individual who wanted to take my flowers away.  He was a Dutchman but after explaining to him that I had just arrived by the South Carolina, he changed like a shot, wanted to kiss me, took me into his house and gave me food. When I told him the flowers were for a lady on board he gave me as many as I could carry.

The Captain would not put a gangway down for us or allow us to use the ship’s boats so we had to climb up a rope to go on board out of the bum boat. Now it's a pretty difficult matter to climb up to a big sailing vessel so I had to put the flowers in my mouth to climb up. When I got on a line with the deck, my friend the mate, tried to take them, but I seized a belaying pin when on deck and dared him to touch them. Of course he guessed who they were for.

The next day I went ashore and at night the 300 passengers bought as many oranges as they could carry. After visiting the hotel, they started singing “We won't go home till morning”. Well, 300 voices make a terrific row and as the people had all gone to bed, they quickly got up and peered through the windows and as each face appeared it was met with a shower of oranges.

I can safely say that on both sides of the street not a pane of glass remained. Next day we sailed and the local newspaper, congratulating its readers on our departure, said we were the most unruly passengers that ever landed on the Cape.

Nothing of any moment happened to us for the the remainder of the voyage excepting one day we were becalmed, and amused ourselves catching albatrosses.  We had 14 on deck at one time and it was curious to see them as they landed on deck.  Each one was sea-sick, and the mess they made on deck was astonishing.  They are a beautiful bird, milk white.  We made a number of articles from them:  their feet, nicely skinned, made grand tobacco pouches;  their breasts made ladies' muffs, their wings made house dusters.  They measured 15ft. across from tip to tip of their wings and were heavy in proportion.

When we reached what was then known as Williamstown we were many of us loath to leave the vessel.  However, the best of friends must part, and so I parted with the Stanleys to meet again in Ballarat but that is another story.

* * * 

On landing I was concerned how I was to get my wooden box to Melbourne.  I arranged with a man going there to take my precious box on his dray and I to ride on top - far better for me to have left it there, as I gave him a £1 to do it.  I could have walked far quicker but like all new chums I stuck to my box, although there was precious little in it.

I got into Melbourne that night, went into the Bull & Mouth in Bourke Street and secured my passage per coach to Ballarat. Then I went to bed, pretty done up. I stayed at Williams Dining Rooms they called them, a pretty primitive place even in those days.

I asked the man to be sure and call me at half past 5 as the coach started at 6.  Of course he didn't.  But I happened to wake up at about 10 minutes to 6.  To jump up, catch up my clothes and rush into the street didn't take me long, and, my word, did I not run with clothes under my arm!  However, I caught the coach and dressed as I went along.

We had six horses to start with and went away in great style but on the next and following stages we had only four and we arrived in Ballarat between 11.00 and 12.00p.m., all of us pretty tired as to ease the horses up the hills and had to get out and walk and that was pretty often.

There was one little episode that rather took the conceit out of me.  Once when we were changing horses, I tried to pass myself off as an old chum (the new chums got bullied so), I went up to the counter and asked for a cobbler of sherry.  I, as an old chum, should have said nobbler.

That settled me.  A big burly fellow at my back yelled out: "Now then, young Lime Juice, get out of the way."  But I drank my sherry.

My brother met me at the coach and after a talk I went to bed.  The next morning what a curious scene met my eyes - bullock drays, horse drays, loading and unloading. My brother did a big business as a wholesale provision merchant.  
There was mud up to our knees, and all wore thigh boots.

I soon got busy and then one of the bullock drivers wanted his freight. My brother was out at the time. I got his cheque book, wrote out the amount and signed it “A.A. Tarte”. When it got to the bank they baulked at the signature written in a schoolboy hand, but the Manager of the Bank, like a brick, at once came up and asked me about it. I told him how it was and he paid the cheque till my brother returned.

He told my brother I should be bound to make my way in the world, and seemed to think a lot of me. He proved it by advancing me £500 but I am anticipating my story.


My brother and I got on all right with a tremendous business but I could not get on with his wife. She, I thought, was jealous of me, so I decided to clear out, and if possible start a business of my own as a produce merchant.

I went and saw the bank manager and after some talk and my brother's guarantee, he advanced me £500 to build a store.  It was only a shell.  I got a ton of hay in from one of the farmers for which I paid £90 and a few bags of oats at 22/6d. a bushel.  I sold the hay at £150 and the oats at 30/- a bushel.  I was alone at the time and did very well as my expenses were nil.  I slept in the hay at night and foraged as best I could for food, but I soon made money.


The kiln dried oats (all we could get) came from San Francisco and as each vessel came in with oats they were put up to auction.  They nearly always arrived in our winter months when the roads between Ballarat and Melbourne were in a shocking state and nearly all bush.

I had a man in Melbourne who came to Ballarat and told me when a vessel from California came in with oats and wheat.  By this time, I was getting on in the world.

I then started on horse-back for Melbourne, 103 miles by road.  Generally I set off about 6.00p.m. and arrived at the auction rooms in the morning in time to bid for the oats.  They were generally sold on a three-months' bill.  By this time, I was well known to Tennant & Co.,  the auctioneers, and could buy in large quantities.  I engaged bullock teams and sent them to Ballarat.  There were no railways or telegraph in those days.

On one occasion I started for Ballarat at night, was busy all day previous to starting; two nights in the saddle and busy all day in the auction rooms, I never tried that again as I found that being busy all day in the store and riding all night was quite enough for me.

Well, I got a big business together and made money but ye gods it was hard work.  I got three employees with me and a splendid lot of horses, both saddle and draught, and of course a bullock dray.  The custom was for the farmers to hawk their produce from store to store as by this time several had started in the produce line and a Municipal Council was formed.

I brought to bear all the pressure I could and induced them to fence off a piece of ground and put up a weighbridge to weigh all the different kinds of produce and start a market

I got a great friend of mine Fred Everingham (a grand fellow who was a farmer), to see the other farmers and call a meeting of them at Cray's (Graig's) Hotel.  I was elected as a broker to sell their produce so I shut my store.

I put up an office and engaged a clerk to do the booking while I was the salesman.  Did I make money!  I paid £950 for a half acre of land and built a huge brick receiving store on it.

As the roads were too bad in winter I carted supplies in during the summer and filled the store with both wheat and oats.  I charged the farmers storage and commission for selling and well they could afford it as prices doubled in the winter.  I was in clover, having the only wholesale store where any quantity could be bought.  Many days my commission alone would be £50 a day.

Oh it was a jolly time, but both me and the clerks worked hard.  Yet I don't recollect ever having made a mistake.  In the market I had any amount of practice and a great crowd to deal with, as by this time both buyer and seller all came into the market.  If a seller sold his produce privately he had to pay his commission on it to me just the same.  That was one of the strict rules I made.

I went to the office at 8.00a.m sharp, came home to dinner at 6.00, left 8.00 to go and check over the day's work and home again at 11.30.  As time went on I broke down and the doctor told me I must give up business or go to the cemetery.

I was pretty run down at the time.  Greenfield, who was the accountant at the London Chartered Bank and I arranged with the Bank to let me overdraw £60,000 to lend the farmers on their deeds while they got their crops in at 10% bank rates and the Bank charged me 7%.

The manager got drunk one day and sent all my cheques back.  Greenfield sent me a note at once.  I rushed to the bank to find the manager speechlessly drunk on the sofa.  Of course any of the banks would be only too glad to take the accounts.

I saw them all separately and they agreed not to send out notices of dishonour until next day when, of course, I had arranged with another bank as my account was far and away the largest and safest account in Ballarat.

My lawyer told me I had an undoubted action against the bank and he wrote to them.  The General Manager came up to Ballarat from Melbourne to see me, but I was too ill to see anyone as it was a great shock to me.  He however, discharged the manager at once and my lawyer strongly advised me not to take action against the bank so I did not.

I sent for Greenfield and sold him the business as it stood at a good round sum, also the brick store.  He carried on ever since and made a considerable fortune.

I often sit back and think of Ballarat as I saw it on my arrival.  There were white tents in all directions.  There was little else in those days.  I built the first brick cottage in Ballarat and had a fine garden and a grand collection of birds from the emus down.

Talking of emus puts me in mind of an action I had against me.  The emu used to get very excited about the time I was coming home to dinner and sometimes used to jump the fence, so anxious was he to meet the horse, Hurricane, I was riding.  They were great chums.

One evening he met a horse he took for Hurricane, went up to him and started jumping about.  It so startled the horse that it landed its rider in the road.


Next day I had a writ served on me claiming £300 damages without my hearing a word about the matter.  I saw the man at once and nothing would suit him but to go to law, although I offered him money to square it and told him he was not hurt a bit, so why bother about a Court.

I employed Aspinall the barrister (a great wit) as my counsel.  He had Ireland.  They were both very expensive men.  Aspinall's defence was that the man came into the country to the bird and the bird was in his own domain.  The defence so surprised Judge Barry that at the end of the case he said he would give his decision next and he did - against me!

The case altogether cost me £140 so I got shut of the bird but it was a magnificent bird and I gave it to the Botanical Gardens.  It afterwards went to Paris Botanical Gardens in France.

Well, I have somewhat got off the track of what I could see in my mind's eye of Ballarat in 1858.  Gold was procured in tons from the different claims.  There was no mining company in those days.  All were in claims for 4,6 or 8 men and the amount of gold from the different claims was marvellous.

The Stanley family, who came out with me, took up a piece of ground on the New Caledonia directly they landed in January, bottomed it at shallow depth and took £65,000 of gold out of it by October.  They left for home 12 months after arrival, and on arrival home what a stir they would make.


Of course there were some duffers of claims but all as a rule were doing grand.  It would be too long and wearisome to recite the different cases but as a Scotsman would say it was a grand time, and I was by no means behind the times.

Well, when I left off, it was a case of either giving up business or going to the cemetery.  I gave up business.  I had always been doing a little in mining and I was pretty fortunate as a rule, so when I gave up business at first I had plenty of time to look about me.

I was too restless for this to suit me long, so after fixing my affairs up and having a month's shooting and fishing I found myself at the Mining Exchange.  At first I kept my eyes very wide open (and you needed to). Afterwards I took an office and laid out myself to buy not the shares but the claims as I found a number of them that had been worked down to water, and they could go no further for lack of funds.

Just after starting I made a grand rise in buying the claim at Blackwoods.  After buying it I went to Melbourne and bought engine, pump and battery, had them carted up, erected, sunk the shaft another 50 feet, put it under the Limited Liability Act of 3,000 shares, and kept 1,000 paid-ups for myself.

The other 2,000, the public fairly rushed at.  I named the mine the Sultan, by which I was well known on the Corner.  These shares went up to £48 and my divend each fortnight was £980 for that mine alone.  For another one a big speculator and myself marked off the ground next to Learmonth, put it under the limit of 5,000 shares and made a lot of money out of it.

Talking of Learmonth puts me in mind of a little go I had at that mine.  It was privately held, and no strangers were allowed to go down and see the working, but I wanted to go and see if they were driving towards the Black Horse, the ground I had taken up.

I arranged with one of the miners to let me go down instead of him.  I took a compass with me.  To allay suspicion I had to take his place at the face and my word it was hard and blistering work, but I got the information I wanted and cleared out at the end of the shift but it was a beastly wet shaft and 300 feet deep.

Mr. Learmonth of Ercildoune Station and owner of the mine sat next to me at Craigs.  In course of conversation he told me he thought of selling out the quartz mine but had to get his brother's consent to sell.  He said he would give me an answer a week hence.

I knew he would want a big price for it so made my arrangements accordingly.  I had the manager of the Union Bank and two others behind me to finance it for I had a lot of money invested in other ways.  Well, he came in on the following Saturday and told me his brother would not think of selling.  After some fencing I offered him £100,000 cash for it as after my trip down below, I knew a little more about it than he did but I was the buyer not the seller.

It was sold a couple of years later through the rascality of the mining manager for £14,000.  The buyers made nearly a million out of it.

Better had they sold it to me.  I should have made a lot out of it but they would have had more money.

I was had once or twice.  On one occasion a speculator came to me.  He was a large shareholder in a mine called the Hand and Band and suggested that we buy up a few hundred shares in the Hand and Band (they were then £23) on joint account, through a broker.

Knowing he was a pretty shrewd fellow I consented.

To make a long story short, I found out that he was selling his own shares to me.  This was looked upon as a fearful thing to do amongst ourselves.

I found him next morning in one of the offices and gave him a fearful hammering.

Not satisfied with this I decided to tar and feather him.  I engaged a loose box at Craig's stables, and took the tar and feathers there.  We intended to strip him and tar and feather him and had a cab to take him into the public street to turn him loose, but some miscreant gave him the tip and he cleared out of Ballarat and has not been seen there since.

By this time I had left my cottage and gone to lie at Craig's Hotel and it was here I met Adam Lindsay Gordon.  The first thing I noticed about him was his thorough indifference to money.  He scarcely ever had any and when he had, he used to give so £1 when 10/- would do.  We were soon to be fast friends.  I would lecture him about being so foolish with his money and told him if at any time he was in a fix for it to come to me.

One morning, sitting in my office in came Gordon.  He walked round a few times with his hands under his coat tail, and then walked out without saying a word.  In he came a second time, did just the same thing, and left.

I saw and heard by his grunts that he was in a fix over something, so when he came in shortly after, I ran and put my back against the door and said “Now whats the matter."  He tried to get out but after a lot of trouble and time (which I could ill spare) he said he was being sued for £50 or £60. At this time he was keeping livery stables at Craig's.

I veritably had to insist on him taking the amount from me. Then out he went and from that time on he avoided me on all occasions. I never had a chance to speak to him after, such was his dislike of being under an obligation to anyone.

After some months I was at the Melbourne Races with my hands behind me (a favorite position) when I had a bundle of notes put in my hand. I turned at once to see Gordon vanishing amongst the crowd without a word. He had just got the notes for riding a Cadger - a steeplechase spoken of in his poems. That same evening he went to Brighton and shot himself. He was a grand fellow - a man who knew no fear.

Oh dear, if I could only put the clock back 50 years what a blessing it would be, not but what my life, in spite of its ups and downs, has been a very pleasant one.  I have seen plenty of fun in it, yet I very much regret leaving so many sincere friends and now that I am getting into the sere and yellow leaf I must soon go, where soon, my friends, we all must go.  But that is sentiment, a thing I don't believe in.

Talking of Gordon reminds me of a steeplechase called the Amateur Steeplechase at the Ballarat racecourse meeting.  Thirteen of us started and to show we were amateurs we all wore white kid gloves.  I had my horse (Hurricane) trained by Harry Mount a great rider and trainer in his day, also Gordon's horse (Cadger) that he rode in another race.  Three days before the races, Gordon came and asked me if I would give him a lead over the water jump, as he was not sure of Cadger and my horse would face anything in the shape of a jump.  Next morning at daybreak we rode our hacks to the course and the grooms took the horses.

It was very cold, but we had to take off our thick top coats and mufflers as Gordon wished to ride in the colours for the sake of his horse.

The water jump was about 3 feet deep and 12 to 14ft. wide with a rail fence sloping over it full of water opposite the grandstand, so we had to come at a pretty good bat to clear the lot.

Well, Gordon and I started six fences off the water jump to get the horses warmed up a bit.  Cadger jumped them all like a bird for he was a grand horse over fences.  After clearing five fences we were then in the rail enclosure and I outside.  We then sat down and raced at it.  Cadger saw the water first.  We were going so fast he could not stop himself but tried to shirk it.  He cannoned against Hurricane and completely turned him round and all four of us were in the water together.  Ye Gods, was it not cold!  A few days after, Cadger, with Gordon up, cleared it like a bird and won the race.

But to come back to my steeplechase.  My dear old Mother was there - the first and only time she was ever on a racecourse but she wanted to see her boy win.  Well, it was, they told me, a pretty sight to see 13 of them charging the water jump together, but it stopped some of them.  The first thing I did was to tear my gloves off, for Hurricane was pulling my arms out.

However, we were sailing away until we got to the stockyards.  I had got my gloves off by this time and had taken a pull at Hurricane.  Orr passed me on Pondon (see Gordon's poems) and struck the fence heavily.  I just caught a glimpse of Orr's backside up in the air and landed in the stockyard.  It was only about 3ft. to jump out of, but 5ft. 10in. to jump in.

We had to go twice round with 32 fences in all 16 each round, of all kinds, consisting of water, stone walls and 3 rail fences and palings, a little over 4 miles.  Only 4 of us got home.  Harry Mount on Hollowback was first.  I was second. 

Whiteside the tailor, the one we all went to, had a job to make up his accounts as Ii would not bet a 1/- in money but new hats and suits of clothes galore and I was very pleased to see others follow my example. 

Herbert Power offered me £350 for Hurricane a big price for a horse in those days. 

Gordon and I went to Melbourne for the Hunt Club there and had a very jolly day - barring when we jumped into the river, but the Lady in Grey led the way and we could not do less.  It is a funny feeling when you strike the water.  It lifts you out of the saddle when the horse goes down.

Well, things were going swimmingly with me and I was worth a lot of money.  I had grand health, no anxiety to bother about and some good friends.  

One day when going on business into the country on a strange horse, to save a long round I was induced to try a most difficult jump.  The horse fell with me and getting up he put his hind foot on my face and smashed my face.  I was taken in a buggy to my sister (Mrs Wilson).  She sent for two doctors and found I had broken a lot of things in my head and face but, worst of all, my eyesight, they thought, was ruined.

They sent in hot haste for the best oculist in Melbourne to come up.  He shook his head and said he was sure one eye had gone but perhaps he might save the other.  I was in bed for three months and eventually ended in my having a glass eye which I have worn ever since.  

Misfortunes never come singly.  While I was in bed, sometimes half and some times wholly delirious, the great smash came where so many people were ruined and I was amongst them.  About three weeks or so before my little accident I had my half year's balance sheet when it showed a clear balance when everything was paid of £19,600, and in a few months after when I was able to look into my affairs, I had not a £100 in the world.  I decided to leave Australia and thought first of going to Africa but then decided to try Fiji where cotton was booming. 

A Mr Fry lent me £150, so I collected with a lot of rubbing up £250 and off I came.

I teamed up with two associates Kington and Robson and we took our passages third class as I knew when we got there we should have to rough it and the sooner we started the better for us, but rough was not the name of it on board.

Well, we got to Suva - the first steamer ever and anchored a long way out because of mud flat. We went ashore to find one Fiji hut on the beach and nothing else in sight. But soon a great crowd of natives had assembled.

They started to land a horse. When the horse was up in the air the Fijians could not make out what it was.  But when the water got shallower and the horse stood up and shook himself, they all took to coconut trees.  The last man up had a bad time as he tried to climb over the other fellow, the first man up could not stand the weight so he let go and down they all came. What a scene it was, amid the roars of the passengers.

We started next morning at daylight and got to Levuka the capital, the same evening.  Here we found a great change.  There was quite a little township of whites and two hotels.  They had come down to plant cottton which was as high as 5/- per lb with two crops a year with from 6 to 10cwts per acre.  They were all mad on it. 


We had our meals at the hotel and slept under the billiard table but when some of them left we were promoted to sleep on the top of the table.  As they were using it till 1.00 or 2.00 a.m., there was not much sleep, and we were up at dawn. 

I may mention here, I saw a Wesleyan missionary in Ballarat who strongly advised me to go to Taveuni on the lee side and I have often had occasion to bless the old boy since. 

When we started from Ballarat, we each had £165 sovereigns in a belt round our waists.  Well, it does not sound much in a belt but when wearing it night and day it took the skin off our hips and I was only too glad to get shut of it. 

When in Levuka we saw Hennings, who owned half of Fiji and was in a big way of business.  We asked him to take charge of the money - nearly £500.  He wanted 5% to do it.  I asked J.C. Smith and he did it at once for nothing so that got over that difficulty.  He put it in a huge safe.  

We put in some days having to look round and waiting for a boat to take us to Savusavu Bay, and other places.  I did not like the look of the country at Savusavu, so went across to Taveuni.  I found Moore and Logan in a little clearing and Hamilton and Wilson next.  All were cotton growing where the thick bush was cut down but where it was not, there were heavy trees and dense bush to the water's edge.  I had a talk with Logan, who said they had a surveyor surveying the block into 300 acres each but a Mr. Drury had the first pick.  Luckily he took what is known now as Drurys.

Our choice was Woodlands, and on our saying we would like to see it, he sent a Fijian with us.  It had very good soil, with a hugh mass of trees and scrubs and we bought it at 10/- per acre - 316 acres.

We had to cut our road with American axes and 14 Inch knives every foot we went. This kept us busy four days before we could get to some rising ground. It took us a week to put up the house, which when finished looked exactly like pictures you have seen of “Robinson Crusoe" being made principally of coconut leaves plaited.  

We then started clearing to plant cotton. The weather was rather against us, as for 16 days and nights it never ceased raining and “Ye Gods" at times didn't it come pouring down. We had not a place finished to make a fire in so could cook nothing but boil a “Billy” in the men's hut and everything we had for 3 weeks was tea without sugar or milk and wild “Yams", and would you believe it we got fat on it. Of course we had to sleep on the ground and often I got up through the night to wring out my clothes and put them on again. After these 3 weeks the weather became fine and we finished our house, got our provisions up and 30 acres cleared and under cotton by December 1870.

I shall never forget the luxury of the first night we had our “stretchers” rigged up, and the roof watertight. The houses were very much like large wicker baskets as the walls were made of canes, the roof of “Tibi-Tibi" (leaf of the sugar cane). The plate glass windows were made of gauze!!! This let the light and air in and kept the flies and mosquitoes out. The floors were laid with mats with coconut leaves underneath, just one partition 6ft. high for our bedroom. Tables, chairs, cupboards, etc. etc. we amused ourselves making of an evening.

We got a very decent first crop of cotton and shipped it home by a schooner that came four times a year but alas the price had fallen to about 1/- per lb.

We had arranged when leaving Ballarat that at the end of 12 months if we desired it we would fix a price for the plantation, then toss up, winner to say whether he was prepared to buy or sell at the price fixed. The reason we came out together was for mutual protection, not knowing what 

**[TODO: Get the first line from page 26 from Susanne.]**

like or the natives.  At the end of 12 months we tossed and I won.

Our agreement had been duly re-registered at the British Consuls, so we three had to go to Levuka and arrange about the transfer.  Of course they wanted their money at once, and I intended to draw on Fry for it, but here a peculiar thing happened. 

There was a kind of Bank of Levuka (The Bank of New Zealand took it over after).  I went in and asked the manager if he would cash a draft, about £800.  I was drawing on Fry at sight.  He said yes at once, and handed the money over to me and all he had was the draft on Fry as security.  I think therefore that I am the oldest constituent in Fiji of the Bank of New Zealand - not that they would do so foolish a thing without security now. 

Here came one of the shocks of my life. I wanted labour to take back with me and went to Warburton, the agent at Levuka, and inquired about some on board the Lismore.

I went on board to see them and I can safely say that never was there a more villainous lot of men together. I thought that if I never had labour I would never take them.

Whittaker met me shortly after and said he had bought them at £14 a head. We made no bones about that in those days. He had chartered the Meva, a 10-ton cutter to take them home to Taveuni.

He asked me to go with him as a passenger. I went on board with him to see her and after inspection did all I knew to stop his going up in her. I pointed out to him there would be a big crowd on board, that he could not draw a line on board to prevent the Darkies coming aft, as that was the rule with natives on board. Kington met me and said he was going up on the Maya too.

I tried hard to stop his going as I was very partial to Kington. Robson I did not like. I persuaded him at least to go and buy a revolver. He was quite half-drunk at the time and would persist in buying a rifle, which was no earthly use in a crowd of Darkies.

They got the 15 Darkies on board that night and Warburton, Whittaker, Kington, Robson and a white Captain with two Fijians as a crew started at 4a.m next morning.  They were becalmed outside the reef that day.

At teatime when they were all sitting on deck the natives got the firewood axe out of the hold and cleaved Warburton's head in half.  They rushed the others, and killed Kington and Robson on deck.  The Captain and two Fijians jumped overboard.

Whittaker, who was a powerful young fellow tried to get to the cabin for his revolver but they killed him there.

One Fijian got ashore after a long swim and came to Levuka with the news. Of course everything was in an uproar about the murders and boats were sent in all directions to head them off.

It so happened the boat I was in was sent in an opposite direction to where they found them seeking water. They had plenty of food on board as they had the bodies of Warburton, Kington and Robson. A few were shot in capturing them and the balance were brought to Levuka.

Well, I got a little boat and started for Taveuni. When I got there, to my joy no news of the murders had reached there, because having gone down with them, my wife would naturally think I was on board with them.

I may say here that I don’t think that if I had been on board the murders would have happened, as I would have my revolver, which never left me night or day. By shooting a few I would have cowed the rest. Besides that, I should certainly have had a line drawn across the deck. It was an awful affair but I suppose it had to be.  

Well, I had over two miles to get home to Woodlands and how to face these two women I did not know. I expected them to be in their homes, but seeing me coming up the plantation, they met me and asked where their husbands were.  

Luckily Mrs Robson had her sister with her.  She saw by my face there was something wrong so took her sister on one side and I am sure I do not know what I said or did.  We hurried her home and she became quite insane and died in the Lunatic Asylum at Ballarat.  
Mrs Kington took to drinking and dies shortly after on Taveuni.  Jack Taylor has that property now. 

To go back in my story, my intended she had for sometime, been living with my dear Mother at Melbourne, waiting for a chance to get to Fiji. She came when the steamer James Paterson was put on for New Zealand and Fiji.  She travelled with John Berry (afterwards Commissioner of Lands) and his sister (alterwards Lady Thurston).  Baron Deste, and Mr & Mrs Burns, who was murdered at Viti Levu afterwards. They all stayed at the Levuka Hotel, where I met them.

By this time the Beach knew there was to be a wedding. All the fellows there were fine gentlemanly types and all expected to be invited, but I did not want to make a holy show of the affair. I kept it as quiet as possible. I got Rev. Floyd who I knew well in Ballarat to go to the back of the British Consul's and I then went with Miss Berry (as she then was) in the opposite direction to hunt for shells, with Clara and Jack Berry going towards the Consul’s and so dodged them all, but they found out while the ceremony was on and we did get a reception. The Consulate was got up in great style ( I think under the Rev. Floyd’s direction) with altar, seats, and flags of all nations decorating the room.

On getting back to the hotel a private room was nicely decorated for a wedding breakfast with about a dozen to it.  This was the first white wedding in Fiji.  

About 4p.m. we went on board Capt. Hill's schooner "Maid of the Mill".  We were becalmed before we could get through Wakay Passage and were hunting up and down the reef trying to find the passage in the dark when on the reef we went.  This was about 10.00p.m.

After bumping there some time and trying to get the schooner off, I saw another ship's light, got Clara into the dinghy and pulled off to the other ship only to find she could not find the Passage either.  

The wind by this time was blowing stiff.  I tried hard to get the ship to stand off till daylight but no, he would find the Passage.  Bye and bye he went on, too, with a great smash and making water fast. 

With a half-caste boy we pulled and pulled to where I thought Wakaya should be. I reached there just after daylight came. Dr. Brewer, the American Consul, took Clara up to his housekeeper and I started off to get my schooner off the reef, got her off with a hole in her, which we repaired, and reached Taveuni about 9pm.

I found Logan, and Mitchell his overseer, there but some vessel had been ashore and the crew had given his labour grog. He got them fastened up and he and Mitchell were guarding the front with rifles.

They begged me to go back. Of course I went, as our lives depended on their not getting out. In their drunken state they would have murdered us to a certainty and collared the ladies.

When my Fijians came down at daylight to carry Clara home to Woodlands there was no love lost between the Tuks and Fijians. We soon had the ringleaders tied up.

When all was quiet I left with Clara, who was carried on a stretcher by four Fijians. I walked with the others, carrying odds and ends from the boat.

I had only been there 5 days when 13 of our men bolted and got away on a boat I took the first boat I could get, and made straight across the Koro Sea as I knew where the men were gone and wanted to head them. We thought to get across before night but had head winds and so got off our course. It came on very dark and blowing hard,  when about 11 o'clock we struck on the dreaded Koro Reef.  The first intimation I had of it (for it was too dark to see the breakers) was being pitched clean out.  Another white and 3 Fijians along with me.  I thought for a minute it was "all up the country" with me and grabbed hold of one of the Fijians and with his assistance I reached the boat, but she was quite useless as she had a large hole stove in her.  She stuck fast on the reef and we stuck to her, the sea washing over us all night.  When daylight broke we found we were not far from Koro Island so we swam ashore completely done up and scarcely a rag on.  We stayed there that day mended up the boat and started again for Levuka to get another boat, and set off for Bua 90 miles off.  I had only been on board a short time when I was taken very ill with dysentery and for 4 days I could scarcely move.  When I reached Bua I got into the dinghy with the master of the boat to go ashore, and when some little distance away he broke his oar and upset us  into the water, I was so weak I could scarcely swim a stroke.  Luckily the tide was coming in so I was washed ashore nearby, but badly bruised and knocked about against the rocks.

I had to lay up for nearly a week living principally on crab, fish and yams, and after that 1 had five weeks of it chasing those black devils, swimming rivers and wading through swamps. I caught 7 of them, and 3 days after 4 more, but the black scoundrel of a Chief or King as they call him let them go again, as I was obliged to leave them in his charge while I went into the Bay to bring my boat up the river. I was really mad when I returned and found them gone again. I fingered my revolver for some time as I was very much inclined to give him the contents of the chambers, and should too if I could have seen the ghost of a chance of getting away, but he had too many chiefs around him and believe me some of them can handle a rifle as well as I.  I bounced them all I could, threatening awful vengeance, if the men were not returned to our plantation which they promised most faithfully to do. I then started for home but with the Devil in close attendance still for it took me a week to come 70 miles as we had calms the whole time.

____This was in March '71____.  The hurricane caught us just as I got home, and blew part of the roof of the house off.  It was only tibitibi and all that day and night I was doing my best to save it.  When I got down off the roof on to the floor I lay there until night, dead to all but asleep.

Poor Clara!  She was almost dead with fright and thought what a country and home to come to.  She could not speak a word of the language and was all alone. 

Next day with the hurricane over I set to work to get the balance of the roof on the house.

For some months I was busy growing cotton but the price was so low it would not pay.  I then heard a rumour that Vatu Wiri was for sale - 120 acres.  I was determined to get it and made two trips to Melbourne, in which a solicitor there, Judge Hood, gave me great assistance.  I finally bought it but I had to pay £10 an acre for part of it.  I had already secured the lease of 540 acres through Thurston.  I eventually had to pay £5 an acre for that.

Sugar was then £35 to £40 per ton and after a long conference with Fry we arranged to put up a mill.

At this time ____annexation was all the rage____.  Two Commissioners Commodore Goodenough and Mr. Layard were sent out from England to inquire if the Chiefs were willing to cede the islands.

A man of war was anchored opposite Vatu Wiri (The Pearl) and the Commodore often came up to see me and talk things over re Annexation, as by this time I was a J.P. for Taveuni.  

To my great joy, annexation came off and a Commission of four was sent out from England to inquire into our titles for the land we held.  Before this, we had only a memo in the books of the British Consul and the agreements with the Chiefs.  My titles were all right but many thousands of acres were confiscated where payment was made in guns, powder, and bullets. 

The Commissioners sat at Wairiki where we all had to go with our deeds or memo.  The excitement was intense as it all lay with Commission whether we got our lands or not and I won't forget that time in a hurry.

Previous to this I had moved from Woodlands to Vatu Wiri.  In the hurricane of '74 I was in a Fijian house.  It came on at night.  We had one child, Herbert, with us and were standing all night at the windward side of the house to rush out in case it blew over.  My Jove, I can hear that house now - creak, creak, not a nail in it, all tied together. 

I made a vow that if ever we got out alive that night I would put up a house that would not creak.  Hence the stone house I am now living in.  I may mention that it was in the Fijian house that Bertie was born.  Rood and Maud were born in the stone house. 

A Colonel Price came out from England to survey our land and he calmly told me I had no land on Taveuni but my land was out in the Koro Sea.  He had gone magnetic north instead of due north.  It was put right after - but not before I had sent away to stop the machinery from England.  

William and Fred Hennings were staying a few days with me.  We were walking through the heavy crop of sugar cane as I had part of Vatu Wiri and leaseland under cane for seed.  I asked them what they would do in my place.  After thinking it over they advised me to plant it all up in coconuts, mind you copra was not thought of those days.  The more I thought of this, the better I liked it and two very shrewd fellows (Peate Bros) advised me, too. 

I got hold of G. McKissock and his schooner and sent him some distance away on other islands for seed nuts and planted them.  They cost me 2d. a piece at least, but like sowing wheat or oats I wanted them a distance away on other soils, so I got about 150 acres planted. 
By this time young Fry came down to me.  He said his father had given him his interest in Fiji.  We arranged to start a store selling everything useful in Fiji.  We put up a concrete store 50 x 30 with a large iron store for bulk goods, but my heart was in my plantation, so I went to Levuka and saw three of the leading firms there.  

I told them what I had done and said "Mind, I have planted these nuts and when I have them bearing in about five years, no matter what I am making in the store, it will be for sale".  

I very soon had a very good business connection and made money.  We had no hurricane for five years and were all making money - or rather spending it.  Coffee was all the rage then on Taveuni and prospects were grand.  A.R. Wilson was getting 1/2 ton to the acre and it was worth 1/- a lb.  Then a hurricane came and swept all away. 

But to return to the store.  At the end of five years I went to Levuka and saw the three leading firms.  One wanted me to bring my books down there and two promised to come up next boat. 

Four days later came the hurricane and it was a corker.  All my buildings round the house stood up as I had built them under my own supervision, but the destruction amoungst the nut trees was awful.  When I went to where my store had been every vestige of it had gone and a 50-ton punt was lying on the site.  

The wind at high tide had gone round to the west and the sea just swept the store away.  Iron bulk store, manager's house etc., had all gone and with it £22,000 of my profits for the five years.  Store, stock, all had gone. 

The Holmhurst Mill by this time was employing a lot of labour so I arranged with the manager to supply him dressed, two bullocks a week.  Afterwards it increased to four.  Our cattle were coming on pretty fast.  Besides, I bought some for my neighbours as four bullocks a week kept one moving in those days. 

As to the store, that was finished.  Of course it was a heavy loss but what could a fellow do when a Fijian hurricane was blowing and the loss on the plantation was no joke.

Fry was with me for some time but his Father kept writing to him to return to Ballarat, and threatening to cut him off in his will so I persuaded him to go. 

I was busy clearing the lease land and planting up nuts.  I bought my next neighbour out.  He had only five acres, for which I paid him £50.  I was glad to get him away as he was running a harem of Tokelaus.

The great smash came when many of the banks closed their doors.  I bought Holmhurst, 980 acres, went to Sydney and bought Vickerys (1,600 acres) and planted up all I could with nuts. 

When I first started, the price of labour was about £6 a year.  I reckoned £8 a ton for copra would pay fairly well.  My last sale was £20 on the ground, with about 3,000 acres planted so that I have done as well as most in Fiji and bar the hurricanes I should be a very wealthy man. 

I am writing this for my two sons, showing them the ups and downs of life, and at the same time showing them that by sticking to it, success must come sooner or later.  Above all I want them to adhere to my motto all through my live: "never to owe a man a shilling you cannot pay him on demand or sooner."

## Section II

**By 1905 the Vuna Estate was a model plantation and was described thus in the Cyclopaedia of Fiji**


"Tram lines were laid over a good portion of the estate, by which the day's work was brought in and put on the vatas, saving an immense amount of labour.

Cattle were largely raised and fattened on the estates, there being about 3,000 head, mostly Herefords.  Stud bulls were imported from Mr. Frand Reynolds, of Tocal, N.S.W. and also from New Zealand.  The cattle were in great demand by the local butchers in Suva.

![James Valentine Tarte](images/IMG_0392.2.jpg)

![Ms. Tarte](images/IMG_0393.2.jpg)

The estates were subdivided into paddocks, surrounded by stone walls, six feet high and some of these were wide enough at the top upon which to drive a buggy and pair.  Over thirty miles of walls were in existence,  and the balance subdivided by barbed wire.  Over one hundred gates were hung, all painted white, giving the estates a thorough home look. 

Great care was taken to keep the estates clean, and the coconut husks were regularly stacked and burnt off.  In laying out a paddock the trees were planted thirty feet apart, and at every twenty lines was a road.  In such places where tram lines were not put down a horse and cart was driven round, and at every thirty trees the copra was collected and carted to the tram lines.  The labourer by this system had only to carry his load a distance of fifteen trees; each man had his own defined line, and many of them had no distance to carry the copra, cutting out alongside the road.  No less than twenty horses were required for this work, including saddle horses for the managers and overseers.

Horses were bred on the estate.  Mules were also raised; the sire being an imported ass from Spain.  Mules are preferred to the horse for working the estates, as the natives can manage them more easily; mules also are more hardy, and stand the wear and tear much better.  The mules average from fifteen to sixteen hands in height, and two of them can with comparative ease walk away with twenty-five full bags of copra.

As a large quantity of young trees were coming into bearing, new buildings, copra stores and vata houses would have to be erected.  A new vata-house cost between £300 and £400.  It should be explained that the vatas are run on steel rails with eight-inch truck wheels, and there are tram lines down from the copra stores to the beach for shipping.  

On the estates are eight large tanks all built on concrete, two of which hold 200,000 gallons and others up to 100,000 gallons each, from which the stock are watered.  The water is supplied by gravitation to large cement troughs, in which the supply is regulated to the cattle by a cock and ball. 

The stockyards are marvels of ingenuity and fitted up with every modern convenience.  The cattle are first brought into one of the home paddocks and driven into a large-size yard (holding about 1,000 head), surrounded by stone walls seven feet high; from these they are drafted into a smaller yard as required, and then through a strong post-and-rail race, with a check gate, in case they should crowd in together.  From this race open four yards, and according to the beast a gate is opened and must go into the yard intended for it.  In the race there are eight swing gates, four on each side, and by this means no handling of the beast or danger to the men is entailed.  The breeding herd is brought in three times a year, and the whole of the herd is mustered once a year for counting.  The fattening paddocks consist of some hundreds of acres set apart for that purpose only, and the remainder of the herd feed under the coconuts furnishing a very pretty sight. In every paddock is to be found a patch of natural bush (Taka Ruru) of about seven acres, most valuable for the shelter of cattle during the heat of the day.  This likewise is equally acceptable to man during the summer season.  Trucks are used in facilitating the quick despatch of fat cattle when sending them to Suva.  The cattle are trucked in the stockyard and then taken down to a small jetty on the beach.  They are then plunged into deep water and taken off to the steamer four and six at a time, roped by the horns to the sides of a whaleboat.  This does away with the old method still in use throughout the islands, of bringing the cattle down in a mob to the beach and then roping them, with a chance of a break and losing the lot, or at least some of the best, to say nothing of the extra risk by drowning.  There are also pigs and an immense quantity of poultry upon the estate. 

Eighty men are employed, consisting of overseers, carpenters and labourers.  In the matter of labour there is preference for the natives of the New Hebrides, but through the scarcity of the former largely Indian labour are used.

The house is a large bungalow, built of stone walls 2ft 4in. thick as a protection against hurricanes.  The hospital, newly erected, is fitted up with every modern requirement.  The labour lines are a township in itself."

J. V. died while on holiday in Australia in 1919.  His body was embalmed and returned to be buried near his home at Vuna.  While the coffin was being lowered into the grave one of the ropes broke and it fell.  There were groans among the assembled mourners and the Fijians muttered that this boded ill for the family.  J. V. was survived by two sons Rood and Bertie and his daughter Maud, and of course, Clarrisa who lived on at Vuna until she died in 1935.
